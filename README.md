# Learning with Texts (LWT)

## Current Version: 25.10.0 (2025-10-25)

**LWT** is a tool for Language Learning, inspired by:

- [Stephen Krashen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Krashen)'s [principles in Second Language Acquisition](https://www.sdkrashen.com/content/books/principles_and_practice.pdf),
- [Steve Kaufmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Kaufmann)'s [LingQ](https://www.lingq.com) application, and
- ideas from [Khatzumoto](https://x.com/ajatt) - published at [AJATT - All Japanese All The Time](https://alljapanesealltheti.me/index.html).

To run LWT, you'll need:

- a modern web browser,
- a local web and database server with PHP - like [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html), [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/mac/), [LAMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)),
- and the LWT application, which can be downloaded here.
