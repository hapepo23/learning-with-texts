# Learning with Texts (LWT) 

LWT is a tool for Language Learning, inspired by:

- Stephen Krashen's principles in Second Language Acquisition,
- Steve Kaufmann's LingQ System, and
- ideas from Khatzumoto, published at "AJATT - All Japanese All The Time".

To run LWT, you'll need:

- a modern web browser,
- a local web and database server with PHP - like XAMPP, MAMP, LAMP,
- and the LWT application, which can be downloaded here.
