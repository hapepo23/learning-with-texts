LWT_INSTALLATION.txt
====================

#############
1. Windows 11
#############

Step 1a: Go to https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html 
Step 1b: Download "XAMPP for Windows 8.x.y (64 bit)".
Step 1c: Open your Downloads folder and run the downloaded
"xampp-windows-x64-....-installer.exe". Please install the 
components Apache, MySQL, PHP and phpMyAdmin (Apache and PHP 
are already selected) into the folder C:\xampp. Start the 
control panel (it can be also started later via the start menu) 
and finish the installer. 
The installer can be deleted afterwards.

Step 2: Go to 
https://github.com/hapepo23/learning-with-texts/archive/refs/heads/master.zip 
and download the latest zip archive "learning-with-texts-master.zip".

Step 3a: Copy the zip archive "learning-with-texts-master.zip" from 
the Downloads folder into the XAMPP installation directory "C:\xampp".
Step 3b: Now right-click on the copied zip archive and select 
"Extract all", and unzip everything into the folder "C:\xampp\htdocs". 
Step 3c: No go to "C:\xampp\htdocs" and rename the folder 
"learning-with-texts-master" to "lwt".
Step 3d: The zip archives "learning-with-texts-master.zip" in 
"C:\xampp" and in the Downloads folders may be deleted.

Step 4: Now go into "C:\xampp\htdocs\lwt". Rename the file 
"connect_xampp.inc.php" to "connect.inc.php". (Sometimes the "php" 
extension is hidden, so be careful! You can display file extensions 
via the Windows Explorer settings and check it.)

Step 5a: Start the "XAMPP Control Panel" 
("C:\xampp\xampp-control.exe") and start the two modules Apache and 
MySQL. Accept the two firewall warnings. Now the two module names 
should have a green background color. 
Step 5b: Open the taskbar settings, and make the XAMPP Control Panel 
icon visible, so you can show or hide it, and you can see the status. 
Step 5c: LWT can now be started. Open a browser, and open 
http://localhost/lwt (please bookmark).

Step 6: You may now install the LWT demo database, or define the first 
language you want to learn. 

If you start up Windows, you must repeat Step 5a+b. 

If you want to start "XAMPP Control Panel" every time you start 
Windows and to avoid Step 5a, put a "XAMPP Control Panel" link to 
"C:\xampp\xampp-control.exe" into 
"C:\Users\(YourUID)\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup". 
To autostart also the Apache and MySQL modules, please open "Config" 
within the XAMPP Control Panel and check the two checkboxes. In order 
to fix a "XAMPP Control Panel" error "Xampp-control.ini Access is 
denied", please run the "XAMPP Control Panel" as admin. 

Now you must only do step 5b to start LWT.

2. macOS
########

I no longer use Apple hardware. 
Therefore, I cannot test LWT itself and the following installation 
instructions on a Mac.
Your help is very much appreciated.

Step 1: Go to https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/

Step 2: Download "MAMP & MAMP PRO" (currently version 6.5).

Step 3: Double-click on the downloaded installation package 
"MAMP_MAMP_PRO_xxx.pkg", accept the license, click on "Install for all 
users..." and on "Continue", on the next panel titled "Standard 
Install on Macintosh HD" click on "Customize", deselect "MAMP PRO", 
and click Install. You must enter your password. After this step MAMP 
is installed within a folder named "MAMP" in the Applications folder.

Step 4: Go to 
https://github.com/hapepo23/learning-with-texts/archive/refs/heads/master.zip 
and download the latest zip archive "learning-with-texts-master.zip". 

Step 5: Copy the zip archive learning-with-texts-master.zip into the 
directory htdocs below the MAMP directory, i.e. 
/Applications/MAMP/htdocs. 
Doubleclick on the zip archive to unzip; a new folder 
learning-with-texts-master will be created in htdocs.

Step 6: Rename the new folder learning-with-texts-master to lwt. The 
zip archive learning-with-texts-master.zip may be deleted.

Step 7: Go to /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/lwt. Rename the file 
connect_mamp.inc.php to connect.inc.php.

Step 8: Open MAMP.app in /Applications/MAMP. Accept the messages from 
the firewall. Apache and MySQL start automatically.

Step 9: LWT can now be started in your web browser, go to: 
http://localhost:8888/lwt.

Step 10: You may install the LWT demo database, or define the first 
language you want to learn. 

If you want to use LWT again, just do step 8 and 9.
The local webserver (MAMP) will be automatically stopped by quitting 
the MAMP application.

Change it to
$passwd = "abcxyz";
Save the edited file connect.inc.php.
